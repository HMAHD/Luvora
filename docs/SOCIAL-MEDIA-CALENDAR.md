#### Instagram (2 posts)

**Post 1 (9 AM) - Reel:**
- **Same as TikTok Post 1** (cross-post)
- **Caption:** "When did 'good morning' texts turn into 'did you see my email' texts? 😭 Let's fix this. Drop a 💔 if you've been there."

**Post 2 (6 PM) - Carousel:**
- **Title:** "5 Signs Your Relationship Lost Its Spark"
- **Slides:**
  1. You only text about logistics
  2. No more random "thinking of you" messages
  3. Conversations feel like obligations
  4. You forgot what made them special
  5. You're reading this and nodding
- **Caption:** "If you nodded at 3+, it's time to be intentional again. Romance isn't dead - it's just on autopilot. Who's ready to reset? 🔥"

#### Twitter (7 tweets throughout day)

**Tweet 1 (8 AM):**
```
Relationship truth:

The person who texts "good morning" first consistently is carrying more emotional weight than you realize.

Don't take that for granted.
```

**Tweet 2 (11 AM):**
```
You know what's unsexy?

Having to ASK your partner to text you more.

You know what's attractive?

Someone who texts you because NOT talking to you feels weird.
```

**Tweet 3 (1 PM):**
```
Hot take: Your relationship isn't boring. You're just lazy.

When's the last time you:
- Sent a random compliment
- Asked about their day (actually listened)
- Texted something that made them smile

Romance = consistent small efforts.
```

**Tweet 4 (3 PM):**
```
Signs you're a green flag partner:

1. You text first without keeping score
2. You respond with energy, not just words
3. You ask follow-up questions
4. You send random appreciation texts
5. You make them feel thought about

RT if you're at least 3/5.
```

**Tweet 5 (5 PM):**
```
Unpopular opinion:

"I'm not good with words" is a cop-out.

You find words when you need to. You find words for your hobbies. You find words when you're passionate.

Just admit you're not prioritizing emotional expression.

Then change it.
```

**Tweet 6 (7 PM):**
```
The difference between "I love you" and "I'm proud of you for [specific thing]"?

One is routine.
The other shows you're paying attention.

Be specific. Notice details. Make your words mean something.
```

**Tweet 7 (9 PM):**
```
Before bed reminder:

If you can scroll TikTok for 20 minutes, you can send your partner a goodnight text.

Effort = 10 seconds
Impact = lasting

They'll sleep thinking about you.
```

### Day 2 - TUESDAY

**Theme:** Agitation - Make the Problem Worse

#### TikTok (3 posts)

**Post 1 (8 AM):**
- **Format:** Duet/Stitch with relationship content
- **Hook:** "This is why your relationship won't last..."
- **Content:** React to someone's toxic texting behavior, provide healthy alternative
- **CTA:** "Save this if you need to hear it"

**Post 2 (2 PM):**
- **Format:** POV
- **Hook:** "POV: You're the only one putting in effort"

- **CTA:** "Tag someone who needs to step up (jk don't do that 😅)"

**Post 3 (7 PM):**

- **Hook:** "Part 2: She said 'you never say anything sweet anymore'"
- **Content:** Continue yesterday's story - the wake-up call moment
- **CTA:** "Part 3 tomorrow shows what I did to fix it"

#### Instagram (2 posts)

**Post 1 (9 AM) - Reel:**
- **Same as TikTok Post 2**
- **Caption:** "If you're carrying the conversation every day, you're in a situationship, not a relationship. Both people should be excited to talk. Period. 💯"

**Post 2 (6 PM) - Quote Post:**
- **Visual:** Beautiful typography on gradient background
- **Quote:** "You can't love someone into loving you back the same way."
- **Caption:** "Real talk: If you're the only one initiating texts, planning dates, and making an effort... you're not in a relationship, you're an unpaid emotional manager. Both people need to show up. Save this if you needed to hear it 💛"

#### Twitter (8 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (8 AM):**
```
Red flag: They text back, but with no energy.

Green flag: They text back AND ask questions because they actually want to know about your day.

Energy > availability.
```

**Tweet 2 (10 AM):**
```
Things that reveal someone's interest level:

1. Response time
2. Response length
3. Question-to-statement ratio
4. Initiative (who texts first)
5. Consistency

If they wanted to, they would.
```

**Tweet 3 (12 PM):**
```
Stop making excuses for people who:
- Take days to reply
- Only text at night 👀
- Leave you on read regularly
- Give one-word responses
- Never ask about you

They're showing you who they are. Believe them.
```

**Tweet 4 (2 PM):**
```
Normalize this in relationships:

Texting good morning because you thought of them first.

Not because they asked.
Not to avoid conflict.
Just because not talking to them feels wrong.

That's the standard.
```

**Tweet 5 (4 PM):**
```
You deserve someone who:
- Texts first sometimes
- Replies with energy
- Makes time even when busy
- Shows you off
- Makes you feel chosen

If you don't have that, you're settling.
```

**Tweet 6 (6 PM):**
```
The bare minimum is not:
- Texting back eventually
- Not cheating
- Remembering your name

The bare minimum is:
- Consistent communication
- Active interest
- Making you feel secure

Raise your standards.
```

**Tweet 7 (8 PM):**
```
Real question:

When's the last time you sent your partner a text that wasn't about:
- What's for dinner
- Confirming plans
- Asking them to do something

Random appreciation texts matter. Don't forget that.
```

**Tweet 8 (10 PM):**
```
Before you sleep:

Send your partner one text about something you appreciate about them.

Not "love you" (that's automatic).

Something specific. Something they did. Something they ARE.

Watch what happens.
```

#### Pinterest (10 pins)
- Focus on "red flag vs green flag" content
- "What his texts reveal about his feelings"

**Post 2 (6 PM) - Carousel:**

```
The 5:1 ratio in relationships:

For every negative interaction, you need 5 positive ones to maintain satisfaction.

Source: Gottman Institute research

Translation: Send appreciation texts. Often.
```

**Tweet 2 (10 AM):**
```
Relationship hack:

Send a specific compliment text once a day for 7 days.

Not generic "you're beautiful."

"I noticed you [specific action]. That's one of the things I love about you."

Watch your relationship transform.
```

**Tweet 3 (12 PM):**
```
Good morning text hierarchy:

😐 "Morning"
🙂 "Good morning"
😊 "Good morning babe"
😍 "Good morning beautiful, hope you slept well"
🥰 "Good morning gorgeous, I dreamed about you"

Effort level = how much you care.
```

**Tweet 4 (2 PM):**
```
Things to text your partner randomly:

"That thing you said yesterday really stuck with me"
"I was telling my friend about you and just smiled the whole time"
"You know what I love about you? [specific trait]"

Stop texting only when you need something.
```

**Tweet 5 (4 PM):**
```
The difference between average and great partners:

Average: Texts when they think about it
Great: Makes thinking about it a daily habit

Consistency > intensity.
```

**Tweet 6 (6 PM):**
```
Pro tip:

Set a daily alarm titled "Appreciate your partner"

Every day at the same time, send ONE text about something you love/appreciate/noticed.

In 30 days, your relationship will be different.

Try it.
```

**Tweet 7 (8 PM):**
```
Text this to your partner tonight:

"I don't say this enough, but I'm really lucky to have you. Thanks for being patient with me, especially when I'm [specific struggle]."

Vulnerability + specificity = connection.
```

**Tweet 8 (10 PM):**
```
Before bed challenge:

Send your partner a text about ONE specific thing they did today that you appreciated.

Not just "love you."

Something SPECIFIC.

Go. Do it now.
```

Title: [Tips] How daily small messages completely changed my relationship

Body:
Context: My girlfriend told me I wasn't romantic anymore. She was right.

I'm not naturally expressive, so this was hard to hear. But instead of getting defensive, I decided to fix it.

What I did:
- Set daily alarm to send her a thoughtful message
- Made them specific (not just "love you")
- Stayed consistent (even on busy days)

Results after 30 days:
- Week 1: She said "you're being sweet lately"
- Week 2: She posted about me (hadn't done that in months)
- Week 3: Our communication overall improved
- Week 4: She brought up future plans (moving in together)

Key lessons:
1. Consistency matters more than grand gestures
2. Specificity shows you're paying attention
3. Daily effort compounds

For anyone struggling with expression: It gets easier. Start small. Stay consistent.

Happy to answer questions!

**Tweet 1 (8 AM):**
```
Okay real talk:

I built something because I was terrible at romantic texts.

Luvora - free daily romantic messages for your partner.

No signup. No cost. Just fresh message ideas every day.

I use it. 50k+ couples use it. Maybe you will too.

luvora.love
```

**Tweet 2 (9 AM) - Thread:**
```
Thread: Why I built Luvora (and why it's free forever)

1/ My girlfriend said "you never say anything sweet anymore"

She was right. After 3 years, I got lazy. Started taking her for granted.

I wanted to fix it but I'm not naturally good with words.

2/ I tried writing my own messages but they felt forced.

I looked for apps - they all wanted $10/month subscriptions.

For TEXT MESSAGE IDEAS.

That felt wrong.

3/ So I built Luvora:
- Fresh romantic messages daily
- No signup (I hate signups)
- No cost (love shouldn't be paywalled)
- Just... help

4/ I started using it. Every morning, send her a message.

Week 1: "You're being sweet lately"
Week 2: She posted about me
Week 3: Our entire communication improved
Week 4: She asked what changed

5/ I told her about Luvora. She thought it was sweet that I:
a) Recognized the problem
b) Found a solution
c) Stayed consistent

The tool didn't matter. The EFFORT did.

6/ Launched it publicly. Hit 1k users in a week. Then 10k. Then 50k.

The messages I get:
"This saved my long-distance relationship"
"My wife screenshots every message I send now"
"I'm not good with words - thank you"

7/ Why it's free forever:

Because I needed it. And if I needed it, others do too.

Love shouldn't be paywalled.

Effort shouldn't be expensive.

8/ If you've ever:
- Stared at your phone not knowing what to text
- Wanted to be romantic but felt awkward
- Let your relationship go on autopilot

This is for you.

luvora.love

9/ Not here to sell you anything (it's free anyway).

Just hope this helps your relationship like it helped mine.

End thread. Happy Friday. Go text your partner something nice.

**Tweet 1 (8 AM):**
```
Week 1 of Luvora: 50,000 users

Messages I'm getting:
"My boyfriend is suddenly romantic again"
"I showed my wife - now we BOTH use it"
"Long distance is easier now"
"She asked what changed in me"

I'm crying in the club rn 😭
```

**Tweet 2 (11 AM):**
```
Favorite Luvora testimonial:

"I'm autistic and struggle with emotional expression. Luvora gives me a template to show my girlfriend I care. She said I'm more thoughtful now. This changed everything for me."

This. This is why it's free forever.
```

**Tweet 3 (1 PM):**
```
Another one:

"My husband isn't romantic. I showed him Luvora. He sends me a message every morning now. I screenshot every single one. After 10 years of marriage, he's making me feel like we just started dating."

😭😭😭
```

**Tweet 4 (3 PM):**
```
Unexpected Luvora use case:

"My dad struggles to text my mom romantic things. I showed him Luvora. They're in their 60s and texting like teenagers now. Mom called me crying (happy tears). Best tool I ever shared."

I'm not crying you're crying
```

**Tweet 5 (5 PM):**
```
Real text I got today:

"Luvora saved my relationship. We were on the verge of breaking up. I started sending daily messages. She said 'you're trying again.' We talked. We're working on it. Thank you."

If just ONE couple stays together because of this... worth it.
```

**Tweet 6 (7 PM):**
```
The thing about Luvora:

It's not magic. It's just consistent effort made easy.

The messages don't save relationships.

YOU save your relationship by CHOOSING to send them.

Luvora just removes the "I don't know what to say" excuse.

The rest is you.
```

**Tweet 7 (9 PM):**
```
If Luvora helped your relationship:

Tell one friend who needs it.

That's it. That's the tweet.

luvora.love
```

**Tweet 8 (11 PM):**
```
Ending the week with this reminder:

Your partner can't read your mind.

Tell them you appreciate them.
Tell them what you love about them.
Tell them they matter.

Use Luvora if you need help.
Use your own words if you don't.

Just don't stay silent.

Goodnight 💛

Title: [Success] Tool that made LDR way easier

Body:
My boyfriend and I are 8 hours apart (time zones).

Communication was getting stale - same "how was your day" every night.

Found Luvora (luvora.love) - free daily romantic messages.

We both started using it. Every morning, send each other a Luvora message + our own addition.

It gave us a "ritual" and sparked better conversations.

Been doing it for a month. Feeling more connected than ever.

Just wanted to share in case anyone else is struggling with LDR communication!
